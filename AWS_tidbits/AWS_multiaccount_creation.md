# Looking to create multiple AWS accounts but only have one gmail?

If you have a gmail account, for example myemail@gmail.com, appending a "+" sign to that account will result in an address that still delivers mail to your original account. You can also do this by adding "." anywhere in the email since gmail ignores ".". 
This will allow you to have multiple AWS accounts under the same email account. 

Use this to create multiple AWS accounts that all pool into the same gmail account.

**Example:**   
myemail@gmail.com ==> Main AWS account.   
myemail+prod@gmail.com ==> Production AWS account.  
myemail+dev@gmail.com ==> Development AWS account.  
myemail+test@gmail.com ==> Testing AWS account. 


Use this trick to seperate your development projects or to experiment with AWS organizations or multi-account access!
